## Supported Record Types

- We support **A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, MX, and TXT** record types.
- DNS is provided by **Gcore**. Unlike Cloudflare, Gcore DNS does **not** include proxy/CDN functionality — all records are DNS-only.


## JSON Formatting

To register your subdomain, create a new JSON file in the `./domains` directory. The filename should be in the following format, `yoursubdomain.til.my.id.json`.

Use the following structure for your JSON file.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Keep only the necessary records, update their values as needed, and <strong>DELETE</strong> the ones you do not need from the JSON.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your JSON file is valid with NO trailing commas. You can easily check the format validity [here](https://jsonlint.com).
